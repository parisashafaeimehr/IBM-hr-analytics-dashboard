# Human Resources Dashboard – Dataset Description

## Overview
Key Performance Indicators (**KPIs**) in the field of Human Resources are powerful tools for evaluating and improving process efficiency.  
These metrics enable organizations to closely monitor HR-related data, make informed decisions, and adopt appropriate strategies for attracting, retaining, and developing their workforce.  

Designing and implementing management dashboards based on these KPIs not only facilitates a better understanding of trends and performance but also helps align operational goals with the organization’s overall vision.  

This project presents the design, analysis, and implementation of a **comprehensive HR dashboard** for managing and optimizing HR processes.
